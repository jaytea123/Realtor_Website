		<h2>Find Your New Home</h2>
		<p>A home is not a home just because of its room dimensions or the color of the walls. It is about how you feel when you walk through the front door. It's about the way you can instantly envision your life unfolding there.</p>

		<p>This is about more than real estate. It is about your life and your dreams.</p>

		<h2>Sell Your Current Home</h2>
		<p>Have questions about selling your home? Are you wondering when is the right time to list your home, or what to expect during the process? I can help inform you on the various factors of selling your home and answer these questions for you. Should you decide to work with me I will go to bat for you to help you get top dollar for your home.</p>

		<h3>About Karl:</h3>
		<p>I have been raised mostly in San Diego and have been active in Southern California real estate for over 14 years. My passion for real estate is coupled with my perseverance to provide the best service for your real estate needs. As a result, these characteristics have been engrained into my personal philosophy. I am not unfamiliar to the term hard work as you will see when you come to work with me.</p>

		<p>My interest in real estate started at a young age. I became a licensed real estate agent shortly after graduating from high school. While establishing myself in the market and with my business I attended college and earn my M.A. at San Diego State University while playing water polo there.</p>

		<p>I have a broad spectrum of experience in residential real estate with an extensive and well-rounded knowledge of the Southern California real estate market. I strive to continuously educate myself and learn more to better facilitate all my clients.</p>

		<p>I sell homes in all price ranges throughout San Diego County. I work regularly with both investors for cashflow, rehab or lease-option, buyers looking to purchase their next home to raise their family in, and sellers. My priority is to provide and maintain the highest ethical and professional service possible when representing all of my clientele.</p>
